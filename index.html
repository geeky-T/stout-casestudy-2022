        Below is a data set that represents thousands of loans made through the
        Lending Club platform, which is a platform that allows individuals to
        lend to other individuals.
        <br />We would like you to perform the following using the language of
        your choice:

        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>Describe the dataset and any issues with it.</li>
          <li>
            Generate a minimum of 5 unique visualizations using the data and
            write a brief description of your observations. Additionally, all
            attempts should be made to make the visualizations visually
            appealing
          </li>
          <li>
            Create a feature set and create a model which predicts interest_rate
            using at least 2 algorithms. Describe any data cleansing that must
            be performed and analysis when examining the data.
          </li>
          <li>
            Visualize the test results and propose enhancements to the model,
            what would you do if you had more time. Also describe assumptions
            you made and your approach.

        There is 1 dataset(csv) with 3 years worth of customer orders. There are
        4 columns in the csv dataset: index, CUSTOMER_EMAIL(unique identifier as
        hash), Net_Revenue, and Year.
        <br />For each year we need the following information:

        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>Total revenue for the current year</li>
          <li>
            New Customer Revenue
            <b>e.g. new customers not present in previous year only</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            Existing Customer Growth. To calculate this, use the Revenue of
            existing customers for current year –(minus) Revenue of existing
            customers from the previous year
          </li>
          <li>Revenue lost from attrition</li>
          <li>Existing Customer Revenue Current Year</li>
          <li>Existing Customer Revenue Prior Year</li>
          <li>Total Customers Current Year</li>
          <li>Total Customers Previous Year</li>
          <li>New Customers</li>
          <li>Lost Customers</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        Additionally, generate a few unique plots highlighting some information from the dataset. Are there any interesting observations?
